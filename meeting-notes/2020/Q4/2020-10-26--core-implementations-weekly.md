### Questions

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

- @gozala: I would like to define (TS) interfaces for the IPFS components like Repo, Bitswap etc.. so our implementations are valiadet against them and that other could implement and validate comliance against. Any opinions üíî/üíö ?
  - Alex: good place to start may be datastore
