    - PR this file into https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt
- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Initiatives
- Blockers (from the async status update)
- General questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases

- js-ipfs 51 ([blogpost](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-10-29-js-ipfs-0-50/))
- Potential 0.8 RC this week
  - QUIC upgrade, should be good to go or almost there
  - go-libp2p-core, should be happening this week unless there are big issues in which case go-ipfs will just update core next time.

#### Pinning Services
@jacobheun / @aschmahmann / @lidel

- Pinning Service API looks pretty good
  - pinning-services-api: [v0.1.2](https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec/releases/tag/v0.1.2) does fast exact name search by default
- Pinning in Datastore looks good, but needs migration + repo bump + some manual testing
  - performance looks great

#### Secio Removal
@jacobheun / @aschmahmann

- Aiming to "flash" support this week on the Bootstrap nodes
  - Plan: 
    - wait 24h and see if anyone notices, if no loud complaints then disable next week
    - after it's disabled we will shutdown the old DHT boosters

#### [js improves discoverability and connectivity](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/703)
@vasco-santos

- Custom announce filter function ready to review
- Custom Dial addr sorter function
- Rendezvous inital integration (no discovery APU) is ready
  - Needs rendezvous implementation review
- Started Auto relay example
  - First example with tests for libp2p
- TODO: also create example for rendezvous

#### Bi-directional streaming and streaming errors in the browser
@achingbrain

- problems
  - can't start receiving data without sending entire data
  - HTTP Trailers are used for passing errors, sadly browsers do not support them
- fix: rpc over medium where we can stream
  - started looking into solutions (websockets, grpc, jsonrpc, http/2), need to evaluate what works in regular browsers

### Other Initiatives
> This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### [Improving webui file add](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3029)
@gozala
- no update

#### [Typescript integration for IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2945)
- added few more pulls that add more annotations

#### Badger 2 support

- no update, waiting for new upstream major release with features we need

#### dnsaddr resolving in JS
@vasco-santos

- multiaddr dnsaddr resolvers are done, merged and released
- PR to integrate on libp2p dial needs final review
  - Bootstrap dnsaddr need to be changed
    - Some unreachable addresses and errors with certificates for non dns multiaddr
    
#### NAT Traversal

- Currently in work plan process

### Design Review Proposals

### Blockers/Asks

### Questions

### Parking Lot
